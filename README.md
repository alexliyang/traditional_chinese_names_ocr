# Chinese_Names_OCR

This repo aims to recognize names in traditional Chinese (MingLiu font).  
I used the CRNN model (1) to extract image features and explore sequency in image features and transcript them to Chinese by CTC.

To train the model, I fixed image height to 36 pixel but keep the weight flexible. The training image is in gray scacle and auto generated by the code in MingLiu font with 36 pixel in height and 248 pixel in width.
